	<section>
		<p><strong><u>California Commonsense Healthcare System Proposal</u></strong></p>
		<p>The people of the State of California hereby enact a comprehensive and universal healthcare system, to be
			known as the California Commonsense Healthcare System, to ensure access to quality, affordable
			healthcare for all residents of the state, providing a cost savings for all Californians through the
			elimination of insurance premiums and related expenses.</p>
		<p><strong>Section 1: Purpose and Goals </strong></p>
		<p>The purpose of the California Commonsense Healthcare System is to ensure access to quality, affordable
			healthcare for all residents of the state, regardless of their income, health status, or any other
			factor. The goals of the California Commonsense Healthcare System are to:</p>
		<p>&middot; Provide comprehensive health coverage to all residents of the state.</p>
		<p>&middot; Provide a net savings for all Californians by eliminating insurance premiums, co-pays, and all
			out of pocket expenses.</p>
		<p>&middot; Control the overall cost of healthcare through a combination of cost-saving measures, including
			reduced administrative costs, increased efficiency, and improved health outcomes.</p>
		<p>&middot; Ensure access to a full range of healthcare services, including but not limited to preventive,
			primary, and specialty care, hospitalization, dental, vision, mental health, and prescription drug
			services.</p>
		<p>&middot; Ensure high-quality, evidence-based care, with a focus on patient-centered, integrated, and
			coordinated care.</p>
		<p>&middot; Minimize administrative burden on patients and healthcare providers.</p>
		<p>&middot; Promote public health and wellness through prevention and wellness programs.</p>
		<p><strong>Section 2: Right to Healthcare. </strong></p>
		<p>All residents of California shall have the right to access comprehensive, high-quality healthcare
			services through the CHS. The state shall not deny or limit the availability of healthcare services to
			any resident <s>based on their income, employment status, or health status</s>.</p>
		<p><strong>Section 3: Savings </strong></p>
		<p>The California Commonsense Healthcare System is expected to result in significant long-term savings, by
			reducing the costs associated with the current fragmented and inefficient healthcare system, and by
			improving the health outcomes of residents of the state. The state will negotiate drug prices with
			pharmaceutical companies and create a bulk purchasing program to lower the cost of prescription drugs.
			These savings will be used to improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare, and to ensure the
			long-term financial sustainability of the California Commonsense Healthcare System.</p>
		<p><strong>Section 4: Administration </strong></p>
		<p>The California Commonsense Healthcare System will be administered by a seventeen-member board of
			directors, appointed by the Governor, and confirmed by the state senate, with representation from key
			stakeholders, including healthcare providers, and patients. The board will be responsible for overseeing
			the implementation and operation of the California Commonsense Healthcare System, including setting
			standards for quality and cost, negotiating contracts with healthcare providers, and ensuring that the
			system is financially sustainable.</p>
		<p>Board of directors:</p>
		<p>1. There shall be seventeen (17) board members. 4-year terms, up to 4 terms.</p>
		<p>2. Board members may be paid.</p>
		<p>3. Board must start with 7 members and be setup within 6 months.</p>
		<p>4. 2 years later, add 6 members and 4 members 2 years after that.</p>
		<p><strong>Section 5: Implementation</strong></p>
		<p>(Mandating that providers accept the same payment rates for all patients regardless of their ability to
			pay.)</p>
		<p>The Implementation of the CHS shall be guided by the Key Design Considerations for a Unified Health Care
			Financing System in California, Final Report, as developed by the California Health and Human Services
			Agency. The California Commonsense Healthcare System will be phased in over a period of four years, with
			a focus on complete coverage and ensuring a smooth transition for patients, healthcare providers, and
			employers. The implementation plan will include provisions for public education and outreach, as well as
			a process for enrolling eligible residents into the California Commonsense Healthcare System. (The
			Report is available here: <a
				href="https://www.chhs.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Key-Design-Considerations_April-2022_Final-Report-for-Distribution.pdf">https://www.chhs.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Key-Design-Considerations_April-2022_Final-Report-for-Distribution.pdf</a>)
		</p>
		<p>&middot; Within ninety days of passing and lasting until full CHS implementation - may end sooner as
			determined by the CHS board of directors:</p>
		<p>o All Californians that have an income at or below 300% of the federal poverty level are eligible for
			Medi-Cal at no cost.</p>
		<p>o Companies with employees that are not offered qualified health insurance will be required to pay an
			annual employment healthcare fee for each employee (full or part-time).</p>
		<p>&sect;More than 50 employees - $10,000</p>
		<p>&sect;10-49 employees - $8,000</p>
		<p>&sect;3-10 employees - $6,000</p>
		<p>&sect;1-2 employees - $2,000</p>
		<p>(To stop companies from dropping their Health insurance offerings to lower income employees, there will
			be a tax penalty. Companies pay an average of just over $6500/year per employee for their share of
			health care. If they have family coverage, they pay over 20k on average.)</p>
		<p>o Maximum annual out of pocket cost per person is limited to $2,000 for any healthcare plan.</p>
		<p>&middot; Within one year:</p>
		<p>o Coverage of health, vision, and dental mandated for all health plans as determined by CHS board.</p>
		<p>&middot; Within 18 months:</p>
		<p>o CHS board shall have a working implementation plan in place based on the Key Design Considerations for
			a Unified Health Care Financing System in California, Final Report, as developed by the California
			Health and Human Services Agency.</p>
		<p>&middot; End of year four:</p>
		<p>o CHS shall be fully implemented.</p>
		<p><strong>Section 6: Quality and Access Provisions</strong></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>To maintain high quality care and ensure access to the healthcare system, all healthcare providers will
			be required to participate in CHS. Providers will not be permitted to bill patients for any covered
			services or charge more than the established payment rates. All healthcare providers will be required to
			accept the same payment rates for all patients, as determined by the CHS board.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><strong>Section 7: Regulation</strong></p>
		<p>The California Commonsense Healthcare System will be subject to state and federal regulations, including
			standards for quality and cost, privacy, and consumer protection. The board of directors will be
			responsible for ensuring that the California Commonsense Healthcare System complies with all applicable
			laws and regulations. The board shall have the authority to set policies, negotiate payment rates, and
			ensure the delivery of high-quality healthcare services to all residents of California.</p>
		<p><strong>Section 8: Funding</strong></p>
		<p>The California Commonsense Healthcare System may be funded through a combination of sources, as follows:
		</p>
		<p>&middot; No person will be charged for healthcare services, insurance premiums, or fees.</p>
		<p>&middot; No taxes for anyone earning 200% of the Federal poverty level or less.</p>
		<p>&middot; A progressive state-wide payroll tax on employers and employees, with a structure to ensure that
			those with higher incomes contribute more.</p>
		<p>&middot; Redirection of existing state healthcare funds.</p>
		<p>&middot; Any available federal funds.</p>
		<p>This proposition, if adopted, would create a comprehensive and universal healthcare system for the state
			of California, ensuring access to quality, affordable healthcare for all residents of the state.</p>
