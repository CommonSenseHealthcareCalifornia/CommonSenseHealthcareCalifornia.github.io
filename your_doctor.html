      <h1 class="title">You Can Keep Your Doctor Under CHS</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        CHS is designed so that patients can continue seeing the doctors, specialists, and clinics they rely on
        today—without losing access due to job changes, insurer withdrawals, or plan switches. Providers participate in
        a single, streamlined system and can see all CHS-covered patients if they meet statewide clinical standards.

      <p class="note">
        Most physicians and healthcare facilities already contract with multiple insurers and public programs; CHS
        builds on that reality with simplified contracting and unified records (SHAS) for better coordination.

      <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Continuity of care:</strong> Long-term patient-clinician relationships support better outcomes,
          fewer hospitalizations, and appropriate use of preventive services.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced administrative barriers:</strong> Less insurer-by-insurer paperwork means more time for
          direct care.</li>
        <li><strong>More stable access:</strong> Access isn't tied to employment or a specific plan's network.</li>
        <li><strong>Better coordination:</strong> Shared standards and unified information let your doctor coordinate
          smoothly with specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How CHS Makes This Possible</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>All licensed providers who meet quality and equity standards may participate.</li>
        <li>Payment rates, contracting, and billing are simplified and centralized.</li>
        <li>The Smart Health Access System (SHAS) keeps records and referrals consistent across providers.</li>
        <li>Clinics and hospitals are encouraged to enroll: participation reduces admin costs and expands access beyond
          coverage restrictions.</li>

      <h2>Continuity-of-Care Provisions</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of CHS is stable, equitable access to care without disrupting established patient-provider
        relationships. Under the new system, <em>your doctor can stay your doctor</em>, and the process of seeking care
        becomes simpler and more consistent for both patients and providers. <!-- Adapted from your content -->
