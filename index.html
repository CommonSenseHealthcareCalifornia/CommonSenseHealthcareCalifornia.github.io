				premiums, co-payments, and other out-of-pocket expenses.</li>

				including reduced administrative expenses, increased system efficiency, and improved health outcomes.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Access to a Full Range of Services</strong>: Ensure the availability of a full spectrum of
				healthcare services, including preventive care, primary care, specialty care, hospitalization, dental,
				vision, mental health, and prescription drug services.</li>
