      <h1 class="title">Why Doctors Benefit From CHS</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        CHS improves patient access and strengthens the day-to-day experience of medical professionals by replacing
        today's fragmented multi-insurer environment with a unified, simplified structure.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        The current system forces clinicians to manage complex billing rules, prior authorizations, and variable
        reimbursement rates. CHS reduces overhead and lets physicians focus on clinical care.

    <section class="card">
      <h2>1. Less Administrative Burden</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Single statewide system replaces dozens of insurers and their paperwork.</li>
        <li>Standardized billing and coding reduce admin time and staffing needs.</li>
        <li>Predictable payment schedules simplify budgeting and reduce disputes.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>2. No Longer Working for Insurance Companies</h2>
      <p>
        Physicians currently spend substantial time navigating insurer requirements. CHS removes these barriers by
        establishing statewide coverage standards so doctors make decisions based on clinical judgment—not insurer
        rules.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>3. Centralized Malpractice Coverage</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Publicly administered malpractice program replaces private negotiations.</li>
        <li>Lower premiums and less volatility than commercial markets.</li>
        <li>Uniform standards for credentialing and claims create predictability.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>4. Greater Clinical Freedom</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>No insurer-specific cost-sharing rules—care follows clinical guidelines.</li>
        <li>Consistent coverage rules support preventive and chronic care management.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>5. Reduced Claim Worries</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Unified payer system minimizes disputes and denials.</li>
        <li>Simplified appeals process reduces delays and admin overhead.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <p>
        By reducing administrative complexity, stabilizing malpractice coverage, and giving clinicians more control over
        treatment decisions, CHS supports a more sustainable and satisfying professional environment for California's
        healthcare workforce.
