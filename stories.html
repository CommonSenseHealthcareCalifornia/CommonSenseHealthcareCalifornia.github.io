            <p class="subtitle">
                Real-world situations that show how fragmented coverage, cost-sharing, and insurer rules hurt
                Californians. CCH removes cost barriers, guarantees comprehensive benefits, and standardizes payment
                and access so care arrives when it's needed.

                <h2>Jeni Rae Peters, a cancer patient left with over $30,000 in medical debt</h2>
                <p>Jeni Rae Peters, a single parent and mental health counselor who was diagnosed with breast cancer.
                    Despite having insurance, Peters was left with over $30,000 in medical debt after multiple
                    surgeries, radiation, and chemotherapy. She faced aggressive debt collection and agonizing choices
                    about her children's education and care. Cancer remains a leading cause of death in the U.S., and while
                    survival rates improve thanks to advanced treatments, the cost burden devastates families.</p>
                <p><h4>CCH ensures that surviving cancer does not mean financial ruin. It prioritizes health over
                debt, allowing families to focus on recovery rather than sacrificing essentials like childcare,
                education, or housing. Peters would not face out-of-pocket costs for surgeries, chemotherapy, or radiation.</h4></p>

                <h2>1 in 5 Americans are living with a mental illness</h2>
                <p>Harold Turner, Executive Director of NAMI Urban Los Angeles, shared his personal experience and emphasizes systemic barriers to care—such as stigma, lack of access, and structural inequities—particularly in communities of color. The pandemic worsened these challenges, increasing isolation and stress. Turner advocates for early intervention, noting that half of mental illnesses show signs before age 14, and stresses the need for outreach, culturally competent resources, and consistent support to prevent long-term harm.</p>
                <p><h4>CCH would transform mental health care from a fragmented, stigmatized, and often unaffordable system into an integrated, accessible, and equitable model—helping families like Harold's get timely support without financial or systemic barriers.</h4></p>

                <h2>Cole Schmidtknecht, died from an asthma attack.</h2>
                <p>A Wisconsin couple filed a lawsuit after their 22-year-old son, Cole Schmidtknecht, died from an asthma attack. Cole had managed his asthma with a daily inhaler for years. When he went to refill his prescription, the price had suddenly jumped from $66 to $539 out-of-pocket. Unable to afford the medication, he left without it and tried to rely on his rescue inhaler. Days later, he suffered a fatal asthma attack. This case highlights how sudden drug price spikes and fragmented insurance systems can lead to tragic outcomes.</p>
                <p><h4>Under CCH, Cole would have walked out of the pharmacy with his inhaler at no cost, and his life would not have been endangered by a sudden, unaffordable price hike.</h4></p>

                <h2>How Years of Caregiving Led to Bankruptcy</h2>
                <p>Amy quit a full-time job to provide care, lost benefits, depleted her savings, relied on credit cards, and eventually accumulated crushing debt despite working long hours and providing extensive unpaid care herself. Despite her parents having retirement savings, pensions, and long-term care insurance, the escalating costs of stroke recovery, Alzheimer's care, paid caregivers, housing, medical expenses, and home modifications quickly overwhelmed their resources.</p>
                    <p><h4>Under CCH, long-term care services—including home-based care, assisted living, and skilled nursing—are guaranteed benefits, eliminating the need for families to privately fund escalating care costs over many years.</h4></p>
